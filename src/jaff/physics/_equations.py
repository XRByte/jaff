"""
Symbolic ODE and flux generators for astrochemical reaction networks.

This module builds SymPy symbolic expressions for:

- **Chemical fluxes** -- the reaction rate multiplied by the number densities
  of each reactant (``get_sfluxes``).
- **Chemical ODEs** -- the net rate of change of each species number density,
  obtained by summing fluxes that produce or destroy each species
  (``get_sodes``).
- **Radiation-moment ODEs** -- the zeroth-moment (energy/photon density) and
  first-moment (energy/photon flux) equations for each frequency band, taking
  into account photoionisation/photodissociation sinks and any user-supplied
  radiation source/sink terms (``get_sradodes``).

The equation of state lives in :mod:`jaff.physics.thermodynamics.eos`.

The symbolic expressions are later code-generated (via SymPy's code printers)
into efficient numerical kernels.

    """
    Build the symbolic reaction flux for every reaction in the network.

    For a reaction with rate coefficient *k* and reactants A, B the flux is::

        flux_i = k_i * nden[idx_A] * nden[idx_B]

    The number densities are represented as indexed-base symbols ``nden`` that
    support scalar indexing (``nden[i]`` for species *i*).

    Parameters
    ----------
    reactions : Reactions
        Collection of all reactions in the network.  Each element must expose
        ``.rate_coefficient`` (a SymPy ``Expr``) and ``.reactants`` (an iterable of
        reactant objects with a string representation matching a key in
        *species*).
    species : Species
        Collection of all species.  Used to look up the numeric index of each
        reactant via ``species[str(reactant)].index``.
    nden : IndexedBase
        The network's density base (``net.symbols.ndens``).

    Returns
    -------
    list of sympy.Expr
        List of length ``reactions.count``.  ``fluxes[i]`` is the symbolic
        flux expression for the *i*-th reaction, or ``Float(0.0)`` if the
        reaction has no rate (should not occur in practice).

                       - sum_{i: s in reactants(i)} flux_i

    Parameters
    ----------
    reactions : Reactions
        Collection of all reactions in the network.
    species : Species
        Collection of all species, used to resolve array indices.
    nden : IndexedBase
        The network's density base (``net.symbols.ndens``).

    list of sympy.Basic

    -----
    The index used for each participant is determined by ``fidx``:

      attribute of the participant object is used (dynamic lookup, e.g. for
      named network slots).
    - Otherwise ``fidx`` is cast to ``int`` and used directly (static index,
      e.g. a literal position in a fixed-order array).

    This dual-path allows the same code to handle both named-species networks
    and fixed-layout networks produced by certain code-generation backends.

def get_sradodes(net: "Network", order: int = 0) -> list[Expr]:
    """
    Build symbolic radiation-moment ODE right-hand sides for all frequency bands.

    The radiation field is described by two moments per band:

    - **Energy/photon density** ``den[i]`` (``radeden`` in erg/cm³, or
      ``photden`` in cm⁻³, depending on ``radiation.mode``).
    - **Energy/photon flux** ``rflux[i]``.

    For each band *i* the function computes:

    - ``grate[i]``: the *source/sink* term for the density moment: the
      photoionisation/photodissociation losses plus the radiation emitted by
      reactions with a spectral yield (``reaction.rad.group_yields`` times the
      reaction rate).
    - ``gflux[i]``: the spatial-gradient term for the flux moment (obtained
      by substituting ``den[i] → rflux[i]`` in ``grate``).

    The two moments for each band are interleaved in the output list according
    to the *order* convention (see :meth:`Radiation.ordered_index
    <jaff.physics._radiation.Radiation.ordered_index>`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    net : Network
        The network whose :attr:`~Network.radiation` field supplies the band
        definitions and per-band per-reaction rate coefficients, and whose
        species provide number-density indexing.  ``net.radiation`` must not
        be ``None``.
    order : {0, 1, 2, 3}, optional
        Layout convention for the output array:

        - ``0`` (default): ``[den_0, flux_0, den_1, flux_1, ...]``
          (energy-density first, interleaved).
        - ``1``: ``[flux_0, den_0, flux_1, den_1, ...]``
          (flux first, interleaved).
        - ``2``: ``[den_0, den_1, ..., flux_0, flux_1, ...]``
          (all densities then all fluxes, energy-density block first).
        - ``3``: ``[flux_0, flux_1, ..., den_0, den_1, ...]``
          (all fluxes then all densities, flux block first).

    Returns
    -------
    list of sympy.Expr
        List of length ``2 * radiation.nbands``.  Even and odd slots (or
        front/back halves for order 2/3) contain density and flux terms
        according to the chosen *order*.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If ``net.radiation`` is ``None`` (no bands have been configured).
    ValueError
        If *order* is not one of ``{0, 1, 2, 3}``.
