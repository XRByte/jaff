# Auxiliary Function Files

An **auxiliary function file** (`.jfunc`) lets you attach custom symbolic expressions to a network without modifying the original network file. You use it to:

- Supply reaction-specific rate coefficients that cannot be expressed with the standard formula.
- Define composite or multi-step reactions whose effective rate coefficient depends on other species densities.
- Provide gas heating and cooling rates that vary with the physical state of the gas.
- Declare global symbolic constants shared across multiple functions.
- Define radiation generation rates per unit photon energy for photo reactions

JAFF automatically looks for a file with the same stem as the network file and a `.jfunc` extension. You can also specify one explicitly:

```python
from jaff import Network

net = Network("networks/GOW/GOW.jet", funcfile="networks/GOW/GOW.jfunc")
```

Although the above examples passes the path to the auxiliary function file explicitly, JAFF automatically detects and parses a `.jfunc` file in the directory which contains the network file. The auxiliary function file **must have the same name as the network file** for this automatic detection to work. So if the network file name is `GOW.jet`, `GOW.jfunc` or `GOW.jet.jfunc` will be detected as an auxiliary functions file.

---

## File Format

A `.jfunc` file contains two kinds of declarations: **global constants** (`@var`) and **named functions** (`@function`).

### Global constants — `@var`

```text
@var name = expression
```

`expression` is a SymPy-compatible expression. It is resolved once and substituted into every function body and variable that references `name`.

```text
@var kB      = 1.380649e-16       # Boltzmann constant  (erg / K)
@var eV      = 1.602177e-12       # 1 eV in erg
@var amu     = 1.66054e-24        # 1 amu in gram
@var TCMB    = 2.73               # CMB temperature at z = 0
@var d2g_solar = 0.01             # Solar dust-to-gas ratio
```

Expressions may reference previously declared `@var` names:

```text hl_lines="3"
@var sigma_SB = 5.670374419e-5
@var c_light  = 2.99892458e10
@var a_R      = 4 * sigma_SB / c_light    # radiation constant
```

### Functions — `@function`

```text
@function name(arg1, arg2, ...)
    # optional per-argument documentation comments
    local_var = expression
    ...
    @return final_expression
```

- Lines inside a function block are **local variable assignments** evaluated in order.
- The block ends with an `@return` statement whose expression is the function's symbolic value.
- Comments (`#`) inside a block may document individual arguments. A comment is attached to an argument's metadata **only when its first word is one of the declared argument names** (`# tgas Gas temperature in K`); any other comment is ignored.
- Long expressions can be wrapped with a trailing backslash `\`.
- `expressions` can contain sympy functions like `Piecewise`

Functions may call other functions defined earlier in the same file.

### Referencing species densities

Functions usually depend on the number densities of species in the network. You
do **not** wire these up by hand — you reference them through reserved symbol
names (typically as the function's arguments), and JAFF substitutes the matching
species density when the network is built. The substitution understands the
following conventions:

| Symbol            | Resolves to                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ntot`            | Total number density (sum over **all** species)                        |
| `n_e`             | Density of the electron (`e-`)                                         |
| `n_<element>_nuc` | Element-nucleus sum, e.g. `n_H_nuc`, `n_He_nuc`, `n_C_nuc` (see below) |
| `n_<species>`     | Density of the named species (see suffix rules below)                  |

For the general `n_<species>` form, the part after `n_` is matched against the
network's species by its j/k-normalized identifier:

- `"+"` is written `j` and `"-"` is written `k` — there is no `0` neutral
  marker. So `n_Cj` → `C+`, `n_Hejj` → `He++`, `n_Hk` → `H-`, and plain `n_H` →
  `H` (the single species, not a sum).
- `n_e` → the electron (`e-`).
- any other `n_<species>` resolves to that exact species' density, e.g. `n_CO` → `CO`.

For the element-nucleus form, `n_<element>_nuc` gives the atom-count-weighted
sum of that element's density over every species bearing it (including ions),
e.g. `n_H_nuc`, `n_He_nuc`. A charge suffix on a nucleus sum (`n_Hj_nuc`) is
meaningless and raises `ParserError`, as does an unknown element (`n_Xx_nuc`)
or a species that does not exist in the network (e.g. `n_Ne` in a network
without neon).

Resolution is an exact reverse lookup, not a trailing-character guess, so
multiply-ionized species and element symbols that end in a charge letter (e.g.
Potassium `K`, tin `Sn`) are unambiguous.

The non-density physical symbols are passed through unchanged and supplied by
the solver at runtime. These are the same canonical symbols available in rate
expressions — `tgas`, `av`, `crate`, `chi`, `d2g`, `tdust`, and so on — listed
in [Rate Expression Variables](network-formats.md#rate-expression-variables).
(`gradv`, the velocity gradient used by the CO cooling fit, is another such
runtime-supplied symbol.)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! note "`n_<element>_nuc` expansion and `expand_nuclei`"
    By default JAFF expands `n_H_nuc`, `n_He_nuc`, and other `n_<element>_nuc`
    tokens into explicit sums over the element-bearing species. Constructing
    the network with `Network(..., expand_nuclei=False)` instead keeps
    `n_<element>_nuc` as a standalone free symbol (e.g. `nh_nuc`).

### Referencing other rate coefficients — `rc_<N>`

Inside a custom `@function` body you can reference the auto-generated rate
coefficient of another reaction by index with the reserved symbol `rc_<N>`,
where `N` is the 0-based reaction index. JAFF resolves `rc_<N>` to the computed
rate coefficient (the `rate_coefficient` of `network.reactions[N]`), so you can build one
reaction's rate or energy term out of another's without restating its Arrhenius
expression.

```text
@function chemRate7(tgas)
    # Reuse the coefficient of reaction 3 (e.g. a shared temperature fit)
    @return 0.5 * rc_3
```

A malformed index (`rc_` not followed by an integer) raises an error naming the
offending symbol and the `.jfunc` file it came from.

### Referencing other rate coefficients — `rc_<N>`

Inside a custom `@function` body you can reference the auto-generated rate
coefficient of another reaction by index with the reserved symbol `rc_<N>`,
where `N` is the 0-based reaction index. JAFF resolves `rc_<N>` to the computed
rate coefficient (the `rate_coefficient` of `network.reactions[N]`), so you can build one
reaction's rate or energy term out of another's without restating its Arrhenius
expression.

```text
@function chemRate7(tgas)
    # Reuse the coefficient of reaction 3 (e.g. a shared temperature fit)
    @return 0.5 * rc_3
```

A malformed index (`rc_` not followed by an integer) raises an error naming the
offending symbol and the `.jfunc` file it came from.

## Reserved Function Names

JAFF recognises seven reserved naming conventions:

| Pattern              | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chemRate<N>`        | Custom rate coefficient for reaction index _N_ (0-based). Replaces the Arrhenius expression in the network file.                                                                                                                             |
| `deltaE<N>`          | Change in gas thermal energy per occurrence of reaction _N_ (erg). Positive = exothermic.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `photoCrossSection<N>` | Photodecay cross section (cm²) of photo-reaction _N_ as a function of photon energy `ph_E` (eV). Replaces the database cross section (see [Custom cross sections](#custom-cross-sections-photocrosssectionn)). |
| `spectralYield<N>`   | Radiation energy (erg) reaction _N_ adds to the field per event per unit photon energy `ph_E` (eV), integrated over solid angle (see [Spectral yield](#spectral-yield-spectralyieldn)). |
| `globalEmissivity`   | **Volume** emissivity: radiation energy emitted per unit volume, time and photon energy `ph_E` (erg cm⁻³ s⁻¹ eV⁻¹) by processes not tied to a reaction, integrated over solid angle (see [Global emissivity](#global-emissivity-globalemissivity)). |
| `globalAbsorptionCoefficient` | Absorption coefficient of the medium: fraction of the radiation absorbed per unit path length (cm⁻¹) as a function of photon energy `ph_E` (eV) (see [Global absorption coefficient](#global-absorption-coefficient-globalabsorptioncoefficient)). |
| `heatingCoolingRate` | Net gas heating minus cooling rate from all non-chemical radiative processes (erg s⁻¹ cm⁻³).                                                                                                                                                 |
| Any other name       | Helper function — substituted symbolically into the bodies that call it.                                                                                                                                                                     |

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Custom function naming"
    Once parsed, the functions are stored in lowercase formats to make them case-insensitive. This is to make sure that they are compatible with languages that are case-insensetive and must be kept in mind while naming functions.

    Note that this applies to **function names only**. `@var` constant names are **case-sensitive** — `kB` and `kb` are different symbols — so a constant must be referenced with the exact case it was declared with.

## Complete Example — GOW Network

The GOW (Gong, Ostriker & Wolfire 2017) network ships with a detailed `.jfunc` file. Excerpts below illustrate the full feature set.

### Global constants

```text
@var kB         = 1.380649e-16
@var c_light    = 2.99892458e10
@var sigma_SB   = 5.670374419e-5
@var a_R        = 4 * sigma_SB / c_light
@var eV         = 1.602177e-12
@var d2g_solar  = 0.01
@var TCMB       = 2.73
@var H2_OPR     = 3.0
@var f_oH2      = H2_OPR / (H2_OPR + 1)
@var f_pH2      = 1 - f_oH2
```

### Helper functions

```text
@function kcr_H_fac(n_H_nuc, n_H, n_H2)
    # n_H_nuc  Total H nucleus density (cm^-3)
    # n_H      Neutral H atom density (cm^-3)
    # n_H2     H2 molecule density (cm^-3)
    @return 2.3 * (n_H2/n_H_nuc) + 1.5 * (n_H/n_H_nuc)

@function kgr_gong(tgas, chi, av, n_e, c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6)
    # tgas Gas temperature (K)
    # chi  Radiation field (Draine 1978 units)
    # av   V-band extinction (magnitudes)
    # n_e  Free electron density (cm^-3)
    # c0 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6  Fitting coefficients
    psi  = 1.7 * chi * exp(-1.87 * av) * sqrt(tgas) / n_e
    logT = log(tgas)
    k_gr = 1e-14 * c0 / (1 + c1 * psi**c2 * \
        (1 + c3 * tgas**c4 * psi**(-c5 - c6 * logT)))
    @return k_gr
```

### Custom rate coefficients — `chemRate<N>`

Reactions whose rate cannot be written as a simple Arrhenius expression get a `chemRate<N>` function where `N` represents the 0-indexed reaction number. The arguments must match the symbolic free variables used in the expression.

```text
@function chemRate0(crate, n_H_nuc, n_H, n_H2)
    # Reaction 0: H + CR -> H+ + e-
    # crate  Primary ionisation rate per H nucleon (s^-1)
    @return kcr_H_fac(n_H_nuc, n_H, n_H2) * crate

@function chemRate14(d2g, n_H_nuc, n_H)
    # Reaction 14: H + H -> H2  (grain-assisted)
    # True rate = 3e-17 * n_H * n_H_nuc * (d2g / d2g_solar)
    # JAFF multiplies by the reactant densities automatically,
    # so we derive k by dividing out the extra n_H factor.
    @return 3.0e-17 * (d2g / d2g_solar) * (n_H_nuc / n_H)

@function chemRate15(d2g, tgas, chi, av, n_H_nuc, n_e)
    # Reaction 15: H+ + e- -> H  (grain-assisted)
    c0 = 12.25
    c1 = 8.074e-6
    c2 = 1.378
    c3 = 5.087e2
    c4 = 1.586e-2
    c5 = 0.4723
    c6 = 1.102e-5
    @return kgr_gong(tgas, chi, av, n_e, c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6) * \
        (d2g / d2g_solar) * n_H_nuc / n_e
```

With radiation transport enabled, a photo reaction with a `chemRate<N>` keeps that rate but is **not coupled** to the radiation bands (it removes no photons), because a custom rate does not depend on the transported field. JAFF logs a warning naming each such reaction. To couple it, supply a [`photoCrossSection<N>`](#custom-cross-sections-photocrosssectionn) instead, or set [`override_custom_rate`](../working-with-networks/jaff-toml.md#custom-photo-rates-under-radiation) to use the database cross sections without editing the `.jfunc`. A reaction cannot have both a `chemRate<N>` and a `photoCrossSection<N>`.

### Thermal energy change — `deltaE<N>`

Functions labeled by `deltaE<N>` are used for representing the internal energy change per reaction. `N` represents the 0-indexed reaction number. The expression returned by these functions are multiplied with the reaction rate and added together to obtain the rate of internal energy change.

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_{i} R_i \Delta E_i
$$

where $R_i$ represents the rate of the $i^{th}$ reaction and $\Delta E_i$ represents the change in internal energy per reaction

```text
@function deltaE40()
    # Reaction 40: H2 + H -> H + H + H  (collisional dissociation)
    @return -4.48 * eV

@function deltaE13(tgas, n_H_nuc, n_H, n_H2, chi, av)
    # Reaction 13: H2 + photon -> H + H
    # Combined FUV-pumping + kinetic-energy heating (Visser+ 2018)
    k_photo = 5.7e-11 * chi * exp(-4.18 * av)
    f = 1 / (1 + ncrH2(tgas, n_H_nuc, n_H, n_H2, k_photo) / n_H_nuc)
    @return (0.4 + 8 * 2 * f) * eV
```

### Custom cross sections — `photoCrossSection<N>`

A `photoCrossSection<N>` function replaces the database cross section of photo-reaction _N_. Its body is the photodecay cross section in cm² as a function of the photon-energy symbol `ph_E` in eV (a bare `E` is Euler's number to SymPy):

```text
@function photoCrossSection5()
    # Reaction 5: flat 1e-18 cm^2 above 11.26 eV
    @return Piecewise((1e-18, ph_E >= 11.26), (0, True))
```

The reaction stores it as `photo.xsec` with `database = "custom"` and no photo-absorption cross section. With radiation enabled it is averaged over each band and over the whole spectrum exactly like a Verner fit, and the band averages set the photo rate. A reaction cannot have both a `chemRate<N>` and a `photoCrossSection<N>` (`ParserError`), nor a per-reaction `pi_database` while its custom cross section is in use.

Setting `override_custom_cross_section = true` (globally in [`jaffgen.toml`](../code-generation/jaffgen-toml.md#networkradiation-section) or `RadiationProps`, or per reaction in `jaffgen.toml` / [`jaff.toml`](../working-with-networks/jaff-toml.md#custom-photo-cross-sections)) ignores the function and uses the database cross section instead. A per-reaction value applies with or without radiation. A `.jaff` file stores the custom cross section, so it survives a reload without the `.jfunc`.

### Spectral yield — `spectralYield<N>`

A `spectralYield<N>` function gives the radiation that reaction _N_ emits: the energy (erg) added to the radiation field per reaction event per unit photon energy, as a function of the photon-energy symbol `ph_E` (eV), so its units are erg eV⁻¹. Supply it already **integrated over solid angle**: the emission is treated as isotropic. Any reaction may have one, photo or not, e.g. radiative recombination:

```text
@function spectralYield7()
    # Reaction 7: H+ + e- -> H, a recombination line near 13.6 eV
    @return Piecewise((2.2e-11 / 0.2, (ph_E >= 13.6) & (ph_E <= 13.8)), (0, True))
```

With radiation transport enabled, JAFF integrates the yield over each radiation group and stores the result on `rxn.rad.group_yields`, in the units of the group density per event:

| `RadiationProps.mode` | Group yield                                  | Units  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `"u"`                 | $\int_\text{group} Y(E)\,dE$                  | erg    |
| `"nph"` (default)     | $\int_\text{group} Y(E)\,/\,E\;dE$ (`E` in erg) | photons |

Each group yield times the reaction rate is added to that group's **density** equation only; isotropic emission carries no net flux, so the flux equations are unchanged. The yield may use other symbols (e.g. `tgas`); such a yield is integrated analytically, so those symbols stay in the generated equations, and it must have a closed-form integral over every group (else `ValueError`). The same holds for a `photoCrossSection<N>`. Energy emitted outside the group range is dropped. Without radiation the yield is stored on `rxn.rad.spectral_yield` but has no effect. A `.jaff` file stores the yield.

### Heating / cooling function

The heating cooling function is used to add any non-chemical heating and cooling rates to the reaction network. The returned `expression` must be in terms of rate of internal energy change in units of $erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-3}$

```text
@function heatingCoolingRate(chi, av, d2g, tgas, n_H_nuc, n_H, n_H2,
                              n_Cj, n_C, n_O, n_CO, n_e, gradv)
    @return heating_grainPE(chi, av, d2g, tgas, n_H_nuc, n_e) \
        - cooling_LyA(n_H, n_e, tgas) \
        - cooling_H2(n_H2, n_H, n_Hj, n_He_nuc, n_e, tgas) \
        - cooling_Cplus(n_Cj, n_H, n_H2, n_e, tgas) \
        - cooling_C0(n_C, n_H, n_H2, n_e, tgas) \
        - cooling_O0(n_O, n_H, n_H2, n_e, tgas) \
        - cooling_CO(n_CO, n_H, n_H2, n_e, tgas, gradv) \
        - cooling_dust_coll(chi, av, d2g, tgas, n_H_nuc) \
        - cooling_dust_rec(chi, av, d2g, tgas, n_e)
```

### Global emissivity — `globalEmissivity`

The `globalEmissivity` function is the network-wide counterpart of `spectralYield<N>`: radiation emitted by processes that are not one reaction (e.g. free-free or dust emission). Its body is the **volume emissivity**: the energy emitted per unit volume, per unit time, per unit photon energy, as a function of the photon-energy symbol `ph_E` (eV), in erg cm⁻³ s⁻¹ eV⁻¹, already **integrated over solid angle** (isotropic emission). There is one per network, with no `<N>`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! warning "Which emissivity?"
    "Emissivity" means different things in different sources. JAFF expects the
    volume emissivity per unit **photon energy in eV**, integrated over solid angle.
    Convert other conventions first (2.418 × 10¹⁴ Hz eV⁻¹ is $d\nu/dE = 1/h$):

    | Convention                                  | Usual units                       | JAFF `globalEmissivity`                                 |
    | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Emission coefficient $j_\nu$, per steradian | erg cm⁻³ s⁻¹ sr⁻¹ Hz⁻¹             | $4\pi\, j_\nu \times 2.418\times10^{14}$               |
    | Angle-integrated $\varepsilon_\nu = 4\pi j_\nu$ | erg cm⁻³ s⁻¹ Hz⁻¹                  | $\varepsilon_\nu \times 2.418\times10^{14}$            |
    | Mass (specific) emissivity                  | erg g⁻¹ s⁻¹ Hz⁻¹                   | $\rho\,\varepsilon_\text{mass} \times 2.418\times10^{14}$ ($\rho$ in g cm⁻³) |
    | Per reaction event                          | erg eV⁻¹                          | not this: use [`spectralYield<N>`](#spectral-yield-spectralyieldn) |
    | Dimensionless (0–1, grey body)               | —                                 | a surface property, not this quantity                   |

    The example below starts from Rybicki & Lightman's angle-integrated free-free
    $\varepsilon_\nu$ (erg cm⁻³ s⁻¹ Hz⁻¹), hence its factor `2.418e14`.

```text
@function globalEmissivity(n_e, n_Hj, tgas)
    # Free-free emission of an ionised hydrogen plasma (Gaunt factor 1)
    @return 6.8e-38 * 2.418e14 * n_e * n_Hj * tgas**-0.5 * exp(-ph_E / (8.617e-5 * tgas))
```

With radiation transport enabled, JAFF integrates it over each radiation group, with the same units rule as the spectral yield (erg cm⁻³ s⁻¹ in `"u"` mode, photons cm⁻³ s⁻¹ in `"nph"` mode), and adds each group's value to that group's **density** equation only. The spectrum is stored on `net.radiation.emissivity`, the group values on `group.emissivity` (with `n_X` symbols resolved to the species densities), and their sum on `net.radiation.total_emissivity`. Other symbols such as `tgas` stay symbolic, which needs a closed-form integral over every group (else `ValueError`). Without radiation it has no effect. A `.jaff` file stores it.

### Global absorption coefficient — `globalAbsorptionCoefficient`

The `globalAbsorptionCoefficient` function gives absorption by the medium itself, beyond the photo reactions (e.g. a grey dust opacity). Its body is the **absorption coefficient** $\alpha$: the fraction of the radiation absorbed per unit path length, in **cm⁻¹**, as a function of the photon-energy symbol `ph_E` (eV). Unlike the emissivity, $\alpha$ is a value *at* each photon energy, not a density per eV. There is one per network, with no `<N>`:

```text
@function globalAbsorptionCoefficient(n_H_nuc)
    # Grey dust absorption: 1e-21 cm^2 per H nucleus at every photon energy
    @return 1e-21 * n_H_nuc
```

    | Given                                  | Units      | $\alpha$                 |
    | -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
    | Cross section $\sigma$ per absorber    | cm²        | $n\,\sigma$ ($n$ in cm⁻³) |
    | Mass opacity $\kappa$                  | cm² g⁻¹    | $\rho\,\kappa$ ($\rho$ in g cm⁻³) |
    | Optical depth per path length          | cm⁻¹       | $d\tau/ds$               |

With radiation transport enabled, JAFF averages $\alpha$ over each radiation group, weighted by the group's assumed spectrum, and removes the absorbed radiation from that group's density and flux equations:

$$
\frac{d\,den_i}{dt} \supset -\,c\,\langle\alpha\rangle_i\, den_i,
\qquad
\frac{d\,F_i}{dt} \supset -\,c\,\langle\alpha\rangle_i\, F_i,
\qquad
\langle\alpha\rangle_i = \frac{\int_\text{group} \alpha(E)\, w(E)\, dE}{\int_\text{group} w(E)\, dE}
$$

with $w(E) = E\,n(E)$ in `"u"` mode (the energy density loses each photon's energy) and $w(E) = n(E)$ in `"nph"` mode (the photon density loses photons). The averages are stored on `group.absorption_coefficient` (with `n_X` symbols resolved to the species densities) and the spectrum on `net.radiation.absorption_coefficient`. Absorption removes radiation from every direction in proportion to the intensity, so it also attenuates the flux $F_i$ (`rflux[i]`), with the same $\langle\alpha\rangle_i$. Set `absorption_attenuates_flux = false` (in `[network.radiation]` of [`jaffgen.toml`](../code-generation/jaffgen-toml.md#networkradiation-section), or `RadiationProps(..., absorption_attenuates_flux=False)`) to apply it to the density equations only. Other symbols such as `tgas` stay symbolic, which needs a closed-form integral over every group (else `ValueError`). Without radiation it has no effect. A `.jaff` file stores it.

!!! warning "Dust module"
    With the [dust module](../code-generation/jaffgen-toml.md#networkdust-section) enabled, dust absorption is already applied to the radiation field. Do not put a dust opacity in `globalAbsorptionCoefficient` as well, or dust absorbs twice.

## Radiation Moment Equations

When a network is loaded with radiation transport enabled (by passing `radiation_props=RadiationProps(bands=...)` to `Network`), JAFF builds a set of **radiation moment equations** alongside the chemical ODEs. Photo-reactions remove radiation from each band they absorb in.

### Radiation density variable — `radeden` / `photden`

Each radiation band carries one density unknown in the generated equations. Its symbolic name depends on how the field is tracked, set by the `mode` of the `RadiationProps` object passed to `Network` (`radiation_props=RadiationProps(bands=..., mode="nph"|"u")`):

| `RadiationProps.mode` | Density variable | Quantity tracked         | Units    |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `"u"`                 | `radeden[i]`     | Radiation energy density | erg cm⁻³ |
| `"nph"` (default)     | `photden[i]`     | Photon number density    | cm⁻³     |

Here `i` indexes the radiation band. The photo-reaction rate coefficient for band $i$ is $k_i = c \cdot den_i \cdot {\langle \sigma \rangle}_i$, where ${\langle \sigma \rangle}_i$ is the band-averaged photoionisation cross section and `c` is the speed of light.

Reactions with a [`spectralYield<N>`](#spectral-yield-spectralyieldn) and the network [`globalEmissivity`](#global-emissivity-globalemissivity) add their emission to the density equations, and the network [`globalAbsorptionCoefficient`](#global-absorption-coefficient-globalabsorptioncoefficient) removes the absorbed radiation from them. The radiation moment equations themselves are available through [`Network.sradodes()`](../../api/core/network/sradodes.md).

## Continuation Lines

Break long expressions across multiple lines with a trailing backslash:

```text
@function myRate(tgas, ne)
    term1 = 3.4e-8 * exp(-7.62 / tgas)
    term2 = 6.97e-9 * exp(-1.38 / tgas) + \
            1.31e-7 * exp(-26.6 / tgas) + \
            1.51e-4 * exp(-8110 / tgas)
    @return (term1 + tgas**-1.5 * term2) / ne
```
